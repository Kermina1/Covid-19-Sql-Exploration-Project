## COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
### Project Overview
This project is dedicated to exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and continents from 2020 to April 2021. The objective is to derive meaningful insights and trends from the data, which can aid in understanding the impact of the pandemic on a global, regional, and country-specific level.
### Dataset
#### The data used in this project is stored in two tables:
- CovidDeaths: Contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population for various locations.
- CovidVaccinations: Contains information on vaccination progress for various locations.
### What I learned 
- Learned how to write efficient SQL queries to handle and explore large datasets.
- Used aggregate functions, join , CTEs, Temp Tables,  Creating Views, Converting Data Types and window functions to derive meaningful insights.
